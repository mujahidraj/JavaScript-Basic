Module-19 : fundamental concept of loops

    19.1 : What is a Loop, explore for loop

        first we are gonna recap all the other thing we have learn throughout this journey .here we get to know that const is a variable which value cannot be changed except special cases . let is a variable which value can be change and var is a variable which we not gonna use it anymore . 
        again we learn about the condition . if else condition . and after that we learn about the array which is a container of some elements . 

        we learn for loops here . like how to print array of elements . 
        structure : 

        for ( const array of array){

        }
        this approach called for of approach .

    19.2 : Introduction to While Loop

       here we learn about the while loop. so when we are gonna use the while loop we must have ue any kind of condition . like 

       while (number1 < number2){
            executable code 
            number1++ / number1+=1 / number1 = number1 + 1 
       } 

       so the structure is : 

       while(condition){
        body of loop
       }

        if we dont use any kind of condition or incremental or decremental it will run in a infinite loop and crash the system . again while loop is a loop which is use to make a loop. 


    19.3 : Problem solving with While Loop

        here we learn about the while loops more . here we do some problem solving like sum of 1 to 10 , odd number from 1 to 100 and even numbers .

    19.4 : Introduction to For Loop

        here we get to know about the for loop .how to write for loop . stracture : 
        for(loop variable ; loop condition ; variable change){
            executable code
        }
        there is little difference between the for loop and while in writing but work is kind of same . for example :
        loop variable
        while(loop condition){
            executable code 
            loop variable change 
        }

        we have the loops using the for loop .
        there we two type of loops like a incremental loop and decremental loop .

    19.5 : Problem solving with For Loop

        here we learn how the incremental loop and decremental loop works using the run and debug with the visual code editor . we can do the decremental with the while loop also . 

    19.6 : Different ways to use loop

        here we get to know about different ways to use the for loops and other loops .

    19.7 : When to use a break and continue

        break is used to make the loop stop . that mean if we want to stop any loop in a specific page . the  we can use the break keyword to stop the loop . 

        structure : 

        for(){
            code
            if(){
                break
            }
        }

        we can yse that in the for loops and also in the while loops . 

        here another thing called continue . continue means skip rest of the code for the iteration . that mean . if we use the continue it will skip the iteration and executable code inside the loop will automatically rusticated and continue for the next iteration .  and break means  break the iteration till the condition is fulfill . 

            structure : 

        for(){
            code
            if(){
               continue
            }
        }


    19.8 :Introduction to Do While Loop

        here we get to know about the do while loop . this work in a particular case . we almost not use that but sometime we will use that . 
        the main thing of the do while loop is it always execute the first output doesn't matter the while condition is fulfill or not . 

        structure : 

        loop variable 
        do{
            executable code 
            variable change 
        }
        while(condition)

    19.9 : Difference between types of loops Module Summary

        here we overview all the things we get to know from this module .
