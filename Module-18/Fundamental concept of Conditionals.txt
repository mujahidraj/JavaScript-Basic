Module - 18 : Fundamental concept of Conditionals

    18.1 : Compare variables and comparison operators

        here we recap our previous module things . like variable , three types of variable . string , boolean and number . naming conventions like single words , no quotes , no gap or dash , can not start with a keyword ,cannot be a keyword . prefer camelCase .we learn about some of the operations like addition , subtraction , multiple , division . again we learn about the IsNaN and null.

        again we learn about the some comparison such as ,

        1. bigger : >
        2. less : <
        3. Equal : ==
        4. greater than or equal : >=
        5.  less than or equal : <=
        6. not equal : !=
        7. add : &&
        8. or : ||

    18.2 : Introduction to Conditionals

        here we learn more about the comparison . like great than , less then , greater than equal , less than equal , equal . again we learn about the "==" .this mean it will compare only the value . again "===" this mean it will compare the value and the type also . again we learn about the not equals to.  

    18.3 : If_else statement (visualization)

        here we learn about the if else , like if this then you can go there else mean otherwise you cant . again we learn if else, else if else if condition . again we learn about the nested if else .

    18.4 : Conditional branching if Else Condition

        here we learn about the structure of if else . 

        like ------

        if(condition){
            execute code if the condition above is true 
        }
        else {
            execute code if the condition above is false
        }

    18.5 : Multiple condition Logical Operators(&&, ||)

        here we learn about the multiple conditional if else . like if there is multiple condition . then we can write the condition in different style ... such as ....

        if (condition && condition){
            execute code
        }

        or 

        if(condition || condition){
            execute code
        }

        or complex condition

        if((condition && condition) || condition){
            execute code
        }


        again we learn about like if we use the "=" this is works as value assign . but "==" means condition check .

    18.6 : Multi level If-else if-else condition

        here we learn about the if else ... else if...else condition . that mean multilevel condition . so th structure is ....

        if (condition){

        }

        else if (condition){

        }

        else if (condition && condition){

        }

        else {

        }


    18.7 : Nested if-else condition

        here we learn about the nested condition or nested if else .

        structure like ....

        if(condition){
            if(condition){
                if(condition){

                }
                else{

                }
            }
            else{

            }
        }
        else if(condition){
            if(condition){

            }
            else{

            }
        }
        else{

        }

    18.8 : (advanced )If-else shorthand Ternary Operator

        we learn about the ternary operator .
        ternary means three parts.
        to write the shorthands we have to write like ....

        simple ternary :
        condition ? do something when true : do something when false  

        normal ternary :
        variable condition ? do something when true : do something when not true .

        Semi advanced ternary :
        variable condition ? condition ? do something when true : do something when false : do something when false 

    18.9 : (advanced) Logical Not Operator
