Module-22 : JavaScript simple coding problems part - 1

    22.1 : JS Concepts recap and var, let, and const

        here we get to know about the variable . there is 3 type of variable ....
        1 . var ---> we wont use that
        2 . const ---> constant . cant not be change
        3 . let ---> changeable.

        variable can be differnet types ... such as ...
        1 . number 
        2 . string 
        3 . boolean 
        4 . undefine 
        5 . null
        6 . object
        7 . array

        there is 2 typpe of category of variable ...
        1 . primitive ---> number , string , boolean , undefine , null
        2 . non primitive ---> array and object 

        N.B: array is a object but it works differently 

        again we get to know about the conditionals . 
        1 . >
        2 . <
        3 . >=
        4 . <=
        5 . ===
        6 . !==
        7 . &&
        8 . ||

        to use the condition we have to use the if(){}else{}

        again we get to know about the array . array can be string , number , object , function , boolean . array's index start from the 0 .
        there is something about the array like ... push , pop , unshift , shift , include , plit , slice , splice and many more 

        again we get to know about the loop . we will use the for of and its recommended . 
        1 . for 
        2 . while 
        3 . for of 
        4 . for in
        5 . foreach
        6 . do while

        related to loops ..
        1 . break
        2 . continue


        here we get to know about the object .
        object hold property and value . object can hold ... string , number , boolean , array , object . object can be access by dot notation and bracket notation . 

        here we get to know about the function . structure ..

        function functionName (){
            code
            return
        }
        call function 
        
        const can be hold string , number , boolean and array . if we use the const we cannot change it leter . but we can push pop value of array . 

        let can be change .
