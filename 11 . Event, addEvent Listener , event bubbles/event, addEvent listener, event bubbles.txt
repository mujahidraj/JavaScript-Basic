Module -26 : Event , addEventListener , event bubbles

    26.0 : Basic of DOM all in one

        here we get to know . what is dow? how dom manipulate html , what is node , how node work , structure of dom , what is parent node , what is childnode . how to create , delete , remove , update html elements  and many more things . 

    26.1 : What is Event, different types of event in web

        here we get to know about the event . event is when a thing will happen for a simple change in process . here we get to know about the onclick . using the onclick a event will happen after clicking the mouse . onclick can happen after clicking a mouse . 
        a special thing we know that we can use the string value in the onclick but in a single quote . 

    26.2 : Add onclick handler directly or via javascript

        here we can use the onclick in a various way . like ...we can use the onclick inline . like onclick(functions);
        again we can do that inside a js file. like we can define a function and then call it from the html onclick attribute . 
        and there is another way to do that is call a element by getelementby id or getelementbyclss and then use that on onclick and then make a function and call the function . it actually not calling the function but to name of the function . 
        another option is callit by document.something and then name a variable and then make a function which will be stored by the variable . 


        1 . directly set on the element 
        2 . make a function and then call it from the element attribute onclick .
        3 . and there is another version . 

    26.3 : Different ways to use addEventListener on a button

        here we can use the eventListener using the addEventListener("typeofEvent",functionName );
        using this we can use anykind of keys that can trigger the even t. but onclick only works on mouse click . 
        another most useful way to use the addeventListener ...

        document.getelementbyid('idname').addEventListener('click',function(){executable code});

        we will use this sometime ...

        const purpleButton = document.getelementbyid('make-purple');
        purpleButton.onlick = function(){executable code};"

        we will use that ....
        in js :
        function makered(){
            executable code
        }
        in HTML : 
        <button onlick="makered()">make red</button>

        we will use this sometime ...

        document.getelementbyid('make-green').addeventlistener('click',function(){
            executable code;
        })

    26.4 : Most common ways to set Event Handlers

        we can do anything using the addeventlistener or onlick to manipulate the html . we can update any kind of text using that . again we can add update text . we can update text from the input field . 

        to get the value of the input field using the addeventlistener cannot use the innerText . so for that we have to use the value keyowrd . which will take the value of the input field and show that . 

    26.5 : Create a comment box and display comment

        we  created a comment box using the thing we have learn throughout the module . 

    26.6 : Simple github like delete confirmation button

        here we first get to knoe about the mouseenter event . thats mean if a mouse enter a specific button or somewhere else event will triggered . 
        another one is mousemove . this will work if the mouse if moved in a specific area . 
        another one is called focus . this will focus the specific thing . 

        we can get the event from the parameter . that mean which event is happening right now we can get that . and we also can get the events specific items . like targeted value of the events . here we leanr about 2 moe events . 1 . keyup which can show the targeted exact value but 2 . keydown it skip the lsat value .

        we can enable or disable a button of a html . like if we use the placeholder . and there we didnt write the exact thing . 

    26.7 : (semi-advanced) Event bubble and Stop propagating

        Event bubble is if i were in a room and the room in a flat and that flat is in a building and that building in a area and that area in a another area . this order called the event bubble . s when we have click a function if there is any other function outside of that it will also be trriggered . this is called the event bubble . 
        to stop the event propagation we have tongive a parameter called event and then inside the function we have to write event.stopPropagation();
        there is another option called stopImediatePropagation(); this will stop the bubble from the imediate events . but the stopPropagation() will stop the bubble but not the imediate one . 

    26.8 : (advanced) Event delegate and benefit of Event bubble
