Module-20 : Fundamentals of String & Objects

    20.1 : Introduction to string and string vs array

        her we get to know about the string . how can we declare string . there is a 4 option to declare the sting . 1 . we can write the string value in single quote ' '. 2 . we can write string in double quote " " . 3 . we can write the string in the backtick ` `. and 4 . we can write string as an object new String (''). 

        string can be count as the array . like we can use the length in ths string . when we can use the index to determine the specific word using that . its behave like a array but actually its not a array . string is a immutable . but array is a immutable . immutable mean it can be changed . 


    20.2 : String Comparison lowercase uppercase and trip

        here we get to know that string id case sensitive . there is 3 type of cases . such as ...
        1 . mixedcase : here is uppercase and lower case is mixed .
        2 . lowercase : to use that we have to use toLower(). this convert all the uppercase alphabet tinto lower case ,

        3 . UPPERCASE : to use the uppercase we have to use toUppercase() . this convert all the lowercase alphabet into the uppercase alphabet . 

        there is another thing called trim . this trim can emit the whitespace from the start and the end  . but not from the inside of the string . trim can emit the whitespace from the string . 

    20.3 : String Slice, Join, Concat and includes

        string is a sequence of character . 
        here we learn another thing called slice . using this we can take specific thing from a string using the slice . the structure : ......slice(starting index , ending index) . there is another thing to do this is str .

        another thing is called split . this slice can slice down a single word or alphabet or anything in a array . if we use split () like this it will make the whole string in a array . but if we use split('') like this it will take every single alphabet . again if we use the split(' ') like this it will take every word counts .
        thats mean whatever we use in the split it will divide according to this . 
        her we learn another thing called join . using the join we can make a join the string value together . 
        again er learn about the concat . using concat we can add two string . like concat(string_name)
        another thing is called includes . this keyword will find out the specific words from the string value . 

    20.4 : Reverse a String in Three different ways
    
        here we learn about the for of loop . its is very necessary to know the array element . just like ...for(const letter of letters){
            executable code 
        }

        that mean it will store elements in the letter from the letters array . 

        we can reverse a string using the reverse = letter + reverse;

        again we can use the for loop or for of loop for find the reverse thing . 

        again we can do in another method . such as first use the split then reverse then join . using this we can achieve the reverse string from the string variable . 

    20.5 : Introduction to Objects properties and values

        object is the non primitive data type or secondary data type . array is a kind of object . object is a container of data type . 

        the structure of object is ...
        const object_name ={
            object_item1 : item_value;
            object_item2 : item_value;
            object_item3 : item_value;
            object_item4 : item_value;

        }
        there could be object inside the object .  there could be string , number , boolean or other data types  .

        inside things of the object is called the object property and value is called the property value .

    20.6 : What is Object Animated video

        object is a variable . and we can store more the one variable inside the object variable . 
        we can store many information in a single variable . the label of the object helps use to arrange the information in a formal ways .

        object can also hold the function too . any kind function can be hold by the object . 

        every information should be store suing the comma after entering the information .

        function inside a object is called the method .

    20.7 : Multiple ways to get & set object properties slide

        here we learn how to print a object . jsut simply print that . again if we want to print a specific property then we have to use the dot notation or dot symbol access . that mean ....
        console.log(objectName.propertyName)

        even we can store a value of a property for a object inside a variable . we can do that like ....
        variableName = objectName.propertyName; 

        again we can access a object property using the third bracket method . so for that there is a another structure like ....
        console.log(objectName['propertyName'])
        another one is ...
        const variableName = objectName['propertyName']

        again we can use the single quotation and name inside the object . but we cannot access that using the dot notation . for that we have to use the third bracket notation . 

        we can also change the value of the object property .  for that simply we have to write ...
        objectName.propertyName = changed value ;
        we can do that in another method :
        object['propertyName']=changedValue;

        so we can get and update using the dot notation or bracket notation .  

        we can get and update in another way like w can a=store the property name in a variable and then print it using the dot .

    20.8 : Keys, Values, nested objects and delete

        here we can get the keys using the object.keys();
        using the keys keyword we can get the all property of the objects .

        we can get the values of the properties using the object.values(); . so using the values keyword we can get the values of the properties of the object . 

        nested object is where there is a object inside a object and we can access that . we can access that using the objectName.secondObjectName.propertyName.
        even we can update the value of a property which is already a nested object property . 
        we can access a object inside a object and there specific value like a nested object's property we can get that using the index number . 
        even if it is not a nested still we can get a specific value using the index number . 

        again we can delete a property of a object using a delete keyword . structure :

        delete objectName.property name . 

    20.9 : Loop an object and Ways to declare an Object

        here we get to know that we can use the loop to see the object property and object value . 
        again we get to know that for in is used for the object and for of is use for the array . 

        so for that we can use the for of to see the property and after that we can use the property for value . 

        again we can use the object,keys() to find out the property and after that we can use the for in in the variable that store the object,keys() . then we can get the value of those properties . 

        we can declare object in several ways . such as ...

        1 . const objectName = {propertyName : value , .....}

        2 . const objectName = new object({propertyName : propertyValue,....})

        3 . const objectName = object.create({propertyName : propertyValue})

    20.10 :  Loop an object and Ways to declare an Object

        here we get to know what is object . object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs . each key-value pair is called a property .
        an entity having state and behavior (property and method)

        array is a ordered collection .
        array has to be declared in a third brackets . in array data can be access using the numerical index . whereas object values are accessed calling keys .
